The original excel file that we downloaded can be found at http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page 
in the tab titled "Bronx." We subsequently opened the document, clicked "file/saveas/rollingsales_brooklyn.csv." This allowed us to 
manipulate and interpret that data as can be seen by the notes following the "#" symbols. The project was pushed to KJ Price's github 
account "kjprice." This repository includes the raw data set that was retrieved from the aforementioned URL, the r generated file 
containing the code and notes used to manipulate the data, and the RMarkdown file with code and results in an easy to follow document.
